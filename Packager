A packager is a software tool that takes in media files (such as video and audio files) and packages them into a format that can be played back on various devices and platforms.

In the context of video streaming, a packager is responsible for:

Transcoding: Converting the input media files into different formats and resolutions to support various devices and platforms.
Segmentation: Breaking the media files into smaller segments, such as chunks or fragments, to enable efficient streaming.
Encryption: Encrypting the media files to protect them from unauthorized access.
Manifest creation: Creating a manifest file that describes the packaged media files, including their format, resolution, and encryption settings.
The output of a packager is typically a set of files that can be played back on various devices and platforms, such as:

DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) files
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) files
MP4 files
WebM files
Packagers can be used for various purposes, including:

Video on demand (VOD): Packaging media files for on-demand streaming.
Live streaming: Packaging live media streams for real-time streaming.
Content protection: Encrypting media files to protect them from unauthorized access.
